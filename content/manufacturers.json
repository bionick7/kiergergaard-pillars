    "description": "<p>Formed during the Union intervention on Casve after the infamous flight of the dragonfly destroyers, General Massif Systems-Humanitarian Intervention and Pioneering Supplier is an autonomously operating department of its parent company. Attached directly to the Union department of justice and human rights, most of its frames will only be found with the military and represent the results of Unions most advanced R&D in de-escalation. Some systems have even reportedly been developed in joined programs with Harrison's Think Tank. </p><p>In the war-torn parts of the Rosengaard Pillar, GMS-HIPS is the most active part of Union's reconstruction efforts. Their pioneers have long settled down in more quiet offices as well though. Not only to develop new methods of reversing harm of previous decades but also new tools for upcoming crisis. With increasing normality, the local factories also started to work in the civilian fields though after some time had passed. They are mostly constrained to constructing heavy agricultural machinery but after heated debate, they also started offering some of their wartime designs to Lancers across the stars. </p><p>Today the pallet includes some of the best chassis on offer for any kind of humanitarian intervention. Some Lancers may gripe about the comparative lack of firepower, but no other manufacturer will ever measure up to GMS-HIPS' dedication to bring even the most cumbersome machinery to where it's needed. Unlike the products of the parent company, the tools from Casve necessitate proper licensing and are only handed out to trusted Lancers who work for the five pillars. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Not a manufacturer but an elite intervention team of the armoury, it's personal developed some field modifications that would gain such notoriety throughout their long and distinguished service that they were imitated by many who witnessed Harrison's burning drop troopers across the stars. Long codified and optimised by the combat engineers, licenses for these machines were eventually pretty swiftly minted to benefit from their popularity.</p><p>Their pilots keep using their trusted machines even after official replications came to be. Each pilot of the Skyhoppers is a true ace and their machines are finetuned to their exact needs. Not even the official Harrison licenses quite replicated the performance of the cobbled together originals. This is probably by design however as even the less potent mass production blueprints easily meet the armoury's reputation for outstanding performance.</p><p>While never deployed during the war in the pillar, the Skyhoppers still maintain a constant presence in the sector these days. The armoury holds no interests here, but its elite squad found a liking of the harsh environments of Jutha and Casve for their rigorous exercises. Reportedly being the most frequently training combat unit of all officially recognised units of the big four, they have become quite a frequent sight in the area and along with them of course their machines and the replica.</p><p>When you gain a license from Harrison Skyhoppers it also counts as a Harrison Armoury license for the purpose of acquiring one of their core bonuses. The Skyhopper's bonuses, are unique to them however.</p>",

    "description": "<p>IPS-N Blackbox is probably the best-known deniable asset across the units of the big four. This might call into question their value as a deniable asset. They garnered quite a reputation as a reliable combat union but their also reportedly prideful to a fault. Many covert operations have been publicly acknowledged by NCOs too full of their success on the battlefield to have it remain secret. While debatably being a massive failure at one part of their mission, the undeniably excel in combat however. </p><p>In many fights along company friendly insurrections, some admitted, others still classified, the highly trained spec ops team fulfilled mission objectives with well-studied coordination. With time, their largest failure, secrecy even started to become another of their strong suits. Seeing immense potential in the coverage these not-so-secret deployments gathered and trusting the skill of their pilots, Blackbox soon found a new identity running highly televised field tests for new IPS-N machines. </p><p>It's unclear if Blackbox has fully transitioned into their role as lab mice or if they remain as a deniable asset. Their deployment in the Rosengaard Pillar is definitely part of the former and has garnered a legendary status ever since the <<Refrigerator Incident>>. Allegedly they are starting to grow impatient, waiting for an opportunity to measure themselves against the Skyhoppers and one thing is already clear. Their machines and commercialised licenses they spawned are already ready and waiting. </p><p>When you gain a license from IPS-N Blackbox it also counts as an IPS-N license for the purpose of acquiring one of their core bonuses. Blackbox bonuses, are unique to them however. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Lanika is a start-up only of noteworthy activity within the confines of the Rosengard Pillar. The young company definitely managed to make an impression here however. Springing up just at the right time, Lanika made a fortune during the efforts to stabilise the region, being the first local manufacturer of proper mechanised chassis to be officiated by Union, it almost became a local monopoly for paramilitary and police forces.</p><p>It's rapid rise to fame comes with many questions. There's a lot of rumours about the origins of the bright orange and often luxurious frames. Some speculate SSC involvement and black-market shenanigans while others accredit the company to the organised underworld wholesale. Whether allegations of money laundering hold true or not matters but little to most of the clientele who keep relying on the manufacturing of the eccentric physicist and company founder Emil Lanhold and his vision of conflict as humanities driver of progress.</p><p>This contentious worldview might be questioned by many, but the products it spawn aren't. Lanika, apart from the conspiracy theories, is best known for being a frontrunner. The innovative systems it brings to bear even overshadowing claims of tech being stolen from the Voladore with no other supplier able to match their novelty with the same quality and safety standards, solidifying it as the regions fastest growing paramilitary contractor.</p>",

Less concerned about shielding allies than its forerunner, the focus is to defeat singular targets with pin-point accuracy in a flurry of attacks. <b> As trials of utilizing Rail technology with different ammunition it was soon apparent that there was little merit in using anything different than a simple metal rod. However by reducing the velocity and increasing the output of the magnetic components, which were fine-tuned during the Witch-series a more \"refined\" propelling armament was created. This was faced with a new problem that potential ammunition (which now needed to be more massive) would overload the modified Metalmark Skeleton and thus the executive decision was taken to allow use of the \"Ammunition\" as melee weapons. Furthermore the Black Polarity Reverser was engineered in order to maximize the destructive output of a singular \"shell\", by striking with it twice.<p>",

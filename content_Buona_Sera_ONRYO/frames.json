The Dismal sylph is focused on providing battlefield support to its Allies while debilitating enemies. It equips an array of systems to further strengthen this identity. All redundancies, much of the weapon systems and most safety measures have been removed in order to make way for the defining characteristic, the Cassandra Scanner, which not only takes up most of the outer layers of the frame, but also demands extreme power output from the micro-reactors. </br>In order to ease the use of the Cassandra Scanner and to increase survivability for the pilot and the frame, experimental movement systems allow for rapid deployment and protection from incoming fire. Zipping between frontline, unfettered by enemy fire, the Dismal Sylph can be found wherever it is needed, alleviating ailments, striking at the weak links in enemy formations, improving or influencing fire arcs.</p>",

    "description": "<p>SSC likes to keep their assets under control. This is an understatement. What many don't know is that in order to perfect a prototype many, many trials must be made. And certain prototypes do not like their status as such. Especially when the first machine is concerned. In order to quell delusions concerning notions like \"personal freedom\", \"unruly behavior\" and \"disloyalty to the company\" the Buona Sera division was created. Under SecCom it was tasked with the suppression of revolts on Corpo-owned planets and elimination of critical assets of opposing sides. And as SecCom fell, so did Buona Sera cease activities. At least officially.<br> Buona Sera's continued existence is one of the best kept secrets of SSC, allowing them to continue operations in morally and legally darker tones. Often embedded into other SSC divisions the members of the Buona Sera monitor from within, sleeper agents ready to be awakened. Only recently have reports landed on Union Desks detailing their brutal Modus Operandi and murky dealings, yet many remain buried among other reports that came in from Ludra's World (now Free Sanjak). Buona Sera is outfitted with some of the newest and most experimental tech offered by the manufacturer, going so far that certain operatives are equipped with prototypes to be used in field testing. The reasons as to why SSC is operating within the Pillars is unknown, only speculations can be made, but most likely it is profit and concerns about new and emerging technologies found within Lanika Corp.</p>",

    "description": "<p>As the collective is vast, there was no question that they would appear in the Pillars, the real question was when. The truth is, they always had small cells embedded within a larger criminal structure within the Pillars. Part of a secretive division within said organization, operatives observed and waited for the right moment to strike. During this time, they exhibited no major abnormalities, contenting with simple lines of conventional code and physical force in order to achieve their goal. Fielding older, standardized forms of frames, they melded into the shadow of their larger and louder host, Lanika. When the latter gave up on staying within the shadows and went public with less shady dealings, the sleeper cells activated and let loose a combination of Electronic and Memetic warheads. They let loose an unknowing amalgam of paracausal code and NHP driven Black ICE, wiping any opposition from the Net. What followed was a brutal take-over of the capital city of Serador on planet XXX in a bloody urban war. What remained in the aftermath is an independent city-state under the control of HORUS ONRY\u014c. Both on the Omni-net and offline, ONRY\u014c monitors and secures, utilizing terror tactics and minimal presence to keep enemies at bay. Now the city of New Serador is a haven for all illegal activity outlawed in Union Space, all under the invisible eye of ONRY\u014c. Frames produced by HORUS ONRY\u014c serve to inspire fear in their enemies and are adapted to the tight space of Urban Warfare. To that end they field an array of domineering, terrifying weapons and systems which break their enemies bodies and minds alike.</p>",

What followed, after a few days an attack from the Omninet on the facility was conducted by an unknown paracausal entity. The surviving personnel suffered 3rd degree burns, furthermore any contained NHP's were missing. The next opportunity succeeded in tracing and analyzing the data: It was raw information of the NHPs cognition, sent to a greater source. Even after two decades of study, the leak cannot be fully plugged. INARI clones exhibit high degrees of curiosity and activity, showing interest in things some might consider mundane and excellent spatial and thermal recognition abilities. These are harnessed to quickly and precisely run targeting and identification protocols, all the while feeding and consuming information from the target. INARI reacts to pilots often with naivety and affection, but they are not to be trusted, for are always harboring other thoughts.<p>\n",

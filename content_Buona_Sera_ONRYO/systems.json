How is not yet entirely understood, but researchers think that BASTET is \u201clying\u201d to reality itself. </br> BASTET exhibits irregular behavior, in the sense that one does not know what will tick them off. They are highly alert and react with extreme prejudice against anything unknown or unaccounted, immediately drawing upon their innate instincts for hiding, stalking and killing. When interacting with Lancer pilots they tend to be both prideful and haughty, yet may develop a deep and respectful partnership over the duration of their continued service. BASTET must be cycled when:  <ol><li> They are able to affect reality not limited to the confines of their designated area of influence (i.e. the licensed Lancers frame)</li> <li> The XXXXX begins rotting. Draft from Visual, scrapped.</li></ol></p>\n",

    "description": "<p>What was thought of by Union Scientists to be a single NHP revealed itself to be something far more concerning. After initial discovery a data leak was found in the codebase of secured and salvaged INARI instances, probes and experiments to capture whatever was leaking failed.  What followed, after a few days an attack from the Omninet on the facility was conducted by an unknown paracausal entity. The surviving personnel suffered 3rd degree burns, furthermore any contained NHP\u2019s were missing. The next opportunity succeeded in tracing and analyzing the data: It was raw information of the NHPs cognition, sent to a greater source. Even after two decades of study, the leak cannot be fully plugged. INARI clones exhibit high degrees of curiosity and activity, showing interest in things some might consider mundane and excellent spatial and thermal recognition abilities. These are harnessed to quickly and precisely run targeting and identification protocols, all the while feeding and consuming information from the target. INARI reacts to pilots often with naivety and affection, but they are not to be trusted, for are always harboring other thoughts.<p>\n",

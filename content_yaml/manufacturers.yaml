  description: <p>Formed during the Union intervention on Casve after the infamous
    flight of the dragonfly destroyers, General Massif Systems-Humanitarian Intervention
    and Pioneering Supplier is an autonomously operating department of its parent
    company. Attached directly to the Union department of justice and human rights,
    most of its frames will only be found with the military and represent the results
    of Unions most advanced R&D in de-escalation. Some systems have even reportedly
    been developed in joined programs with Harrison's Think Tank. </p><p>In the war-torn
    parts of the Rosengaard Pillar, GMS-HIPS is the most active part of Union's reconstruction
    efforts. Their pioneers have long settled down in more quiet offices as well though.
    Not only to develop new methods of reversing harm of previous decades but also
    new tools for upcoming crisis. With increasing normality, the local factories
    also started to work in the civilian fields though after some time had passed.
    They are mostly constrained to constructing heavy agricultural machinery but after
    heated debate, they also started offering some of their wartime designs to Lancers
    across the stars. </p><p>Today the pallet includes some of the best chassis on
    offer for any kind of humanitarian intervention. Some Lancers may gripe about
    the comparative lack of firepower, but no other manufacturer will ever measure
    up to GMS-HIPS' dedication to bring even the most cumbersome machinery to where
    it's needed. Unlike the products of the parent company, the tools from Casve necessitate
    proper licensing and are only handed out to trusted Lancers who work for the five
    pillars. </p>

  description: <p>Lanika is a start-up only of noteworthy activity within the confines
    of the Rosengard Pillar. The young company definitely managed to make an impression
    here however. Springing up just at the right time, Lanika made a fortune during
    the efforts to stabilise the region, being the first local manufacturer of proper
    mechanised chassis to be officiated by Union, it almost became a local monopoly
    for paramilitary and police forces.</p><p>It's rapid rise to fame comes with many
    questions. There's a lot of rumours about the origins of the bright orange and
    often luxurious frames. Some speculate SSC involvement and black-market shenanigans
    while others accredit the company to the organised underworld wholesale. Whether
    allegations of money laundering hold true or not matters but little to most of
    the clientele who keep relying on the manufacturing of the eccentric physicist
    and company founder Emil Lanhold and his vision of conflict as humanities driver
    of progress.</p><p>This contentious worldview might be questioned by many, but
    the products it spawn aren't. Lanika, apart from the conspiracy theories, is best
    known for being a frontrunner. The innovative systems it brings to bear even overshadowing
    claims of tech being stolen from the Voladore with no other supplier able to match
    their novelty with the same quality and safety standards, solidifying it as the
    regions fastest growing paramilitary contractor.</p>

  description: <p>Not a manufacturer but an elite intervention team of the armoury,
    it's personal developed some field modifications that would gain such notoriety
    throughout their long and distinguished service that they were imitated by many
    who witnessed Harrison's burning drop troopers across the stars. Long codified
    and optimised by the combat engineers, licenses for these machines were eventually
    pretty swiftly minted to benefit from their popularity.</p><p>Their pilots keep
    using their trusted machines even after official replications came to be. Each
    pilot of the Skyhoppers is a true ace and their machines are finetuned to their
    exact needs. Not even the official Harrison licenses quite replicated the performance
    of the cobbled together originals. This is probably by design however as even
    the less potent mass production blueprints easily meet the armoury's reputation
    for outstanding performance.</p><p>While never deployed during the war in the
    pillar, the Skyhoppers still maintain a constant presence in the sector these
    days. The armoury holds no interests here, but its elite squad found a liking
    of the harsh environments of Jutha and Casve for their rigorous exercises. Reportedly
    being the most frequently training combat unit of all officially recognised units
    of the big four, they have become quite a frequent sight in the area and along
    with them of course their machines and the replica.</p><p>When you gain a license
    from Harrison Skyhoppers it also counts as a Harrison Armoury license for the
    purpose of acquiring one of their core bonuses. The Skyhopper's bonuses, are unique
    to them however.</p>

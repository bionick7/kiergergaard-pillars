description: Combined arms tactics shape the battlefield since before Union. While
  mostly rendered obsolete thanks to the advent of the mobile chassis, the infantry
  man still plays a vital part in some operations.
effect: When you hit with an attack, the next attack performed by a biological ally
  against the same target gains +1 accuracy, and its damage can't be reduced in any
  way.

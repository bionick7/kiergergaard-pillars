  active_effect: The Kraken, while not quite as fast firing then a Leviathan can far
    outpace most targeting system. The Amundsen was thus fitted with a purpose build
    targeting system to unleash its full potential in a controlled chaos. When activating
    the core, it can strike against an unlimited number of targets until the bullet's
    run out. Doing so as part of a simple skirmish or barrage, you choose two targets
    and automatically engage all targets within range in-between the arc formed by
    both. (counterclockwise). Both targets are of course included. You shoot indiscriminately
    doing so, engaging all targets, enemy and allied within this arc. You need to
    expend a charge of your Kraken MG for each and every one of these attacks and
    can only attack each target once during the ensuing hailstorm.

description: 'Developed from the Drake, the Amundsen aims to offer the same potency
  in firepower its sister platform brought to the table but with a drastically increased
  capacity for mobile warfare. Greatly suffering in its protection, the advanced cooling
  integrated into the barrel of the frames primary mounting guarantees combat performance
  on par with the larger predecessor. After it''s introduction in the Zaobalde Lunar
  War Amundsen has become IPSN most relied upon chassis for mobile firepower in fast
  advances despite failing in naval service. '

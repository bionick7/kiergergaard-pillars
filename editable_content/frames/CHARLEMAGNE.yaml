    bright enough to melt steel. At expense of your own safety being shredded while
    the core is active, thus negating the benefits of your reactive emergency armour,
    you gain the ability to reconstruct on the battlefield scavenging from the enemies
    ripped armour pieces, regaining 1d6 hp whenever you perform a critical hit. '

description: Bulky but deadly the Charlemagne hulks across the fields of AHB5 and
  slams rebels into submission after its birth out of destroyed Barbaro ssa frames
  and Think Tank prototypes on the field of war. This frontline giant has been dubbed
  a monstrosity of engineering by some in armoury offices but became beloved across
  it's teams who fast took a liking to the experimental armour that weakened the structure
  but offered great reactive protection in emergencies allowing for the use of devasting
  yet unstable Harrison prototypes.

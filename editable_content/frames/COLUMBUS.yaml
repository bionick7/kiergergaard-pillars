    effect: You flare up their position in response, no matter if the hit or not ignoring
      sensors and line of sight. Flare up, the enemy becomes locked on. You and all
      allied characters may ignore invisibility and cover when consuming this Lock-on.
    frequency: Unlimited
    name: Strike Orientation Signalling
    trigger: An enemy targets you or any adjacent allied character with a non-tech
      attack
  activation: Reaction
  active_effect: 'Whenever your Strike Orientation Signalling triggers, you may choose
    to active your core in conjunction with it. Once activated, the core grants an
    immediate retaliatory strike against the attacking enemy. This attack takes the
    form of a full barrage if possible but as it''s a reaction, Superheavies can''t
    be fired in this way. The attack happens immediately after the enemy''s attack
    has resolved, whether it hit or not and can be performed by you or any adjacent
    allied character. Whoever takes the attack takes 4 heat doing so. '

  among them. Heavy artillery presence in the sector lead to new problems that soon
  turned into solutions at Northstar and so a sophisticated counterbattery system
  was developed. Build to target and destroy enemy artillery positions and ammo depots
  the Columbus might underwhelm initially in its firepower favouring precision it
  is unmatched in its domain.

  - activation: Quick
    detail: <p>This system can only be used when your core is active and only holds
      three charges. This amount can't be raised by any means. Expending a charge,
      you may cool down completely. You don't stabilize doing so and don't get any
      additional advantages.
    name: Fire Nitrogen Emergency Pack
  active_effect: <p>For the rest of this scene the Bolzman heat pump takes on all
    the heat instead of half once activated. You also gain the <i>Nitrogen Emergency
    Packs</i> quick action. <br></p>

  passive_effect: <p>As a quick action, you may latch onto any character adjacent
    character. Until either of you breaks adjacency you may take half the heat they
    take no matter the source. </p>

description: <p>Developed from reverse engineered Harrison reactors the Kilimanjaro
  fire suppression and heat management chassis presents a breakthrough in reactor
  safety. Ongoing Union trials even conduct trials on the system as a countermeasure
  to total biome kills combining the strongest heat pump ever used on chassis with
  superb ABC-protection. No matter if it serves on carriers at the reactor unit, pushes
  fast deployment units to their limit or suppresses wildfires, the Kilimanjaro is
  a favourite to everyone looking to fight heat.</p>

- description: When receiving any amount of burn damage, the Kilimanjaro first gains
    overshield equal to 4 + GRIT before taking damage. Additionally, it has immunity
    to all heat from external sources as long as it benefits from this overshield.
    This does not apply to heat from your Thermal Control Package.

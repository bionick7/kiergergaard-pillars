core_system:
  activation: Quick
  active_effect: Once activated, this core lasts until you clear all heat. While active
    it greatly enhances the capability of the Hustler's Jetpack. It now allows you
    to boost as a free action 1/round and leaves a trial of fire as you go. White-hot
    flames continue to burn along your path affecting every space you've flown over,
    lasting until the end of your next turn. When characters start their turn in one
    of these spaces or enter one for the first time in a round, they take 1d6 energy
    damage. You gain one heat every turn you spend with your afterburners active.
    This heat counts for the purposes of keeping your jetpack active.
  active_name: 'Full Afterburner '
  name: Dragon's first flight field modification
  passive_effect: Each round you may choose to count any and all of your movement
    as flying after taking any amount of heat. You start to fall whenever you clear
    all heat.
  passive_name: Hustler's Jetpack
description: Once based on the Genghis MK II the Schwarzkopf was such a popular frontline
  modification that it was minted as a fully unique license built around its flight
  systems. Stemming from front line tinkering the frame is prone to breakdown and
  highly dangerous to operator as well as foe.

  active_effect: <p>You disengage all safety measures on your Solar Lance. Doing so
    takes a full action and afterwards you can only fire your Lance as if it were
    a superheavy weapon. Without limiters, the weapon gains ordonance status but its
    range is raised to line 15 and the damage increases to 16-range. It also melts
    all ground in a burst 3 area additionally to your full line 15. It can only be
    fired once in this mode and reverts  back to normal operation automatically afterwards.</p>

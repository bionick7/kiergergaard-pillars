description: <p>Formed during the Union intervention on Casve after the infamous flight
  of the dragonfly destroyers, General Massif Systems-Humanitarian Intervention and
  Pioneering Supplier is an autonomously operating department of its parent company.
  Attached directly to the Union department of justice and human rights, most of its
  frames will only be found with the military and represent the results of Unions
  most advanced R&D in de-escalation. Some systems have even reportedly been developed
  in joined programs with Harrison's Think Tank. </p><p>In the war-torn parts of the
  Rosengaard Pillar, GMS-HIPS is the most active part of Union's reconstruction efforts.
  Their pioneers have long settled down in more quiet offices as well though. Not
  only to develop new methods of reversing harm of previous decades but also new tools
  for upcoming crisis. With increasing normality, the local factories also started
  to work in the civilian fields though after some time had passed. They are mostly
  constrained to constructing heavy agricultural machinery but after heated debate,
  they also started offering some of their wartime designs to Lancers across the stars.
  </p><p>Today the pallet includes some of the best chassis on offer for any kind
  of humanitarian intervention. Some Lancers may gripe about the comparative lack
  of firepower, but no other manufacturer will ever measure up to GMS-HIPS' dedication
  to bring even the most cumbersome machinery to where it's needed. Unlike the products
  of the parent company, the tools from Casve necessitate proper licensing and are
  only handed out to trusted Lancers who work for the five pillars. </p>

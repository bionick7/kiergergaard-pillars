description: <p>Not a manufacturer but an elite intervention team of the armoury,
  it's personal developed some field modifications that would gain such notoriety
  throughout their long and distinguished service that they were imitated by many
  who witnessed Harrison's burning drop troopers across the stars. Long codified and
  optimised by the combat engineers, licenses for these machines were eventually pretty
  swiftly minted to benefit from their popularity.</p><p>Their pilots keep using their
  trusted machines even after official replications came to be. Each pilot of the
  Skyhoppers is a true ace and their machines are finetuned to their exact needs.
  Not even the official Harrison licenses quite replicated the performance of the
  cobbled together originals. This is probably by design however as even the less
  potent mass production blueprints easily meet the armoury's reputation for outstanding
  performance.</p><p>While never deployed during the war in the pillar, the Skyhoppers
  still maintain a constant presence in the sector these days. The armoury holds no
  interests here, but its elite squad found a liking of the harsh environments of
  Jutha and Casve for their rigorous exercises. Reportedly being the most frequently
  training combat unit of all officially recognised units of the big four, they have
  become quite a frequent sight in the area and along with them of course their machines
  and the replica.</p><p>When you gain a license from Harrison Skyhoppers it also
  counts as a Harrison Armoury license for the purpose of acquiring one of their core
  bonuses. The Skyhopper's bonuses, are unique to them however.</p>

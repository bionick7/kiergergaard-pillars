description: <p>IPS-N Blackbox is probably the best-known deniable asset across the
  units of the big four. This might call into question their value as a deniable asset.
  They garnered quite a reputation as a reliable combat union but their also reportedly
  prideful to a fault. Many covert operations have been publicly acknowledged by NCOs
  too full of their success on the battlefield to have it remain secret. While debatably
  being a massive failure at one part of their mission, the undeniably excel in combat
  however. </p><p>In many fights along company friendly insurrections, some admitted,
  others still classified, the highly trained spec ops team fulfilled mission objectives
  with well-studied coordination. With time, their largest failure, secrecy even started
  to become another of their strong suits. Seeing immense potential in the coverage
  these not-so-secret deployments gathered and trusting the skill of their pilots,
  Blackbox soon found a new identity running highly televised field tests for new
  IPS-N machines. </p><p>It's unclear if Blackbox has fully transitioned into their
  role as lab mice or if they remain as a deniable asset. Their deployment in the
  Rosengaard Pillar is definitely part of the former and has garnered a legendary
  status ever since the <<Refrigerator Incident>>. Allegedly they are starting to
  grow impatient, waiting for an opportunity to measure themselves against the Skyhoppers
  and one thing is already clear. Their machines and commercialised licenses they
  spawned are already ready and waiting. </p><p>When you gain a license from IPS-N
  Blackbox it also counts as an IPS-N license for the purpose of acquiring one of
  their core bonuses. Blackbox bonuses, are unique to them however. </p>

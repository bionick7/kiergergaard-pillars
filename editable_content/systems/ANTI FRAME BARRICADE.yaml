  detail: The barricade generates a line 5 barrier 5 spaces high centred on the box
    on the ground level. The barrier is magnetic blocking all frames and other large
    non-biological objects (not squads) from passing, it doesn't grant cover and won't
    stop attacks however. It only prevents frames from passing through it.

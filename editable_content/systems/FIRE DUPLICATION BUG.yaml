  detail: Choose an allied character in sensors and line of sight. They are protected
    by a white hat trojan until the end of their next turn. When an enemy inflicts
    heat on them while this protection is active, the enemy must succeed on an engineering
    save or take as much burn from their action as it inflicted heat. Only one ally
    can benefit from this effect at any given time. If you target another allied character
    before it would have ended, it resolves automatically on your previous target.

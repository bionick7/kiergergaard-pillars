description: <b>TODO</b>
effect_print: In order to use the chainsaw, the motor must first be kick started as
  a protocol. Once started it lasts 3 turns, generating 1 heat during each turn no
  matter if it was used or not. This effect only seizes to trigger when the weapon
  is destroyed while running. As the chainsaw works its way through enemy armour it
  deals increased damage with every attack. For each successful attack against a target
  deal 1d6 bonus damage on continuous attacks against that same target.

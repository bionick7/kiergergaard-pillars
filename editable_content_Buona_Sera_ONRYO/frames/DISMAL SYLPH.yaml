  passive_effect: <p>When you move into an adjacent space with an Ally or Enemy for the first time on your turn, you roll a d6 and note the result. As a 1/turn Reaction, you may add or subtract the number to the roll of a character within Sensors. These count as Accuracies or Difficulties and may be canceled out by their respective rules, but stack on top of them. That way you can cancel out an enemy Accuracy or improve the Accuracy of an Ally.
    </br>You can hold up to two Numbers at once and lose one, your choice, at the beginning of your turn.
    </br>Your mech gains the AI tag if it doesn’t already have it, however this does not count towards the maximum number of AI’s.<p>

description: <p>The SSC Dismal Sylph is considered a daughter platform to the Swallowtail and Duskwing, it was developed with the aim to bring powerful supportive capabilities to a more “civil” audience. Officially the frame is still in development, which is of course a lie, live-target testing has begun. The Dismal sylph is focused on providing battlefield support to its Allies while debilitating enemies. It equips an array of systems to further strengthen this identity. All redundancies, much of the weapon systems and most safety measures have been removed in order to make way for the defining characteristic, the Cassandra Scanner, which not only takes up most of the outer layers of the frame, but also demands extreme power output from the micro-reactors.
  </br>In order to ease the use of the Cassandra Scanner and to increase survivability for the pilot and the frame, experimental movement systems allow for rapid deployment and protection from incoming fire. Zipping between frontline, unfettered by enemy fire, the Dismal Sylph can be found wherever it is needed, alleviating ailments, striking at the weak links in enemy formations, improving or influencing fire arcs.</p>

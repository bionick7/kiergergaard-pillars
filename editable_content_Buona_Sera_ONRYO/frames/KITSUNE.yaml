  description: HORUS ONRYŌ needed a way to quickly cool off some of their more advanced computing rigs when close 
    to the melting point, with most conventional options being either too demanding in energy or space. 
    Both could be circumvented, but data mining in the AGNI-codebase gave way to a new idea.

description: <p> Few reports exist of the PG Kitsune, their arrival to the combat zone of Serador was during the
  late stages of engagement. Their appearance is deceiving, their true nature only revealed as combat continues,
  that of an unassuming hardsuit is quickly shed, heat flaring up as their powerful computing system kicks into overdrive.
  </br> A new approach to combined electronic and martial warfare, Kitsune force their enemies into submission by crippling 
  their systems and attacking them from within. Wreathing themselves in living flames, the spinal heat dispersion systems
   can support up to 9 “tails of fire”, a trait shared across all PG members and the pin-point which allowed their
  recording into the Universal Threat Assessment Manual. <p>

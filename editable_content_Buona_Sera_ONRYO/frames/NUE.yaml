  use: Scene
description: <p>The Nue was long unidentified, but the existence of another long-range ballistic platform designed to mount both firepower and computing systems was theorized among Union Scientists. It was first confirmed after an Urban engagement which nonetheless saw use of tremendous firepower during heavy weather from criminal elements, followed by devastating attacks through the Omni-net. Contrary to most doctrines, the Nue does not immediately aim to destroy its target, rather tormenting it with electronic warfare after a single, well placed hit. 
  </br> The confusion surrounding the existence of this PG is furthermore exacerbated by the visual similarities to the Manticore PG as the heat-dispersion spines have been modified to artificially charge the surrounding atmosphere to create an artificial, Single-cell thunderstorm. Dubbed the Thunderhead and cladding the battlefield in rain, accompanied by the rumble of thunder, the Nue shoots. What follows is a poorly understood process by which the target's position is “marked” both within the storm and on an local-/Omni-net basis. Any Electronic attack now is carried via the storm itself, the masses of static energy at the whim of the pilot. </p>

    <p> 1/round, when you hit an enemy with a Ranged attack, you may mark them with this Trait. 
    As long as they remain marked, you ignore Line of Sight and Sensor requirements when targeting 
    them with Invades. Only one Mark may exist at a time and when you mark another character, 
    the old mark ceases to exist. </p>

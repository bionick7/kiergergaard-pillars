description: <p>SSC likes to keep their assets under control. This is an understatement. What many don’t know is that in order to perfect a prototype many, many trials must be made. And certain prototypes do not like their status as such. Especially when the first machine is concerned.
  In order to quell delusions concerning notions like “personal freedom”, “unruly behavior“ and “disloyalty to the company” the Buona Sera division was created. Under SecCom it was tasked with the suppression of revolts on Corpo-owned planets and elimination of critical assets of opposing sides. And as SecCom fell, so did Buona Sera cease activities.
  At least officially.<br>
  Buona Sera's continued existence is one of the best kept secrets of SSC, allowing them to continue operations in morally and legally darker tones. Often embedded into other SSC divisions the members of the Buona Sera monitor from within, sleeper agents ready to be awakened. Only recently have reports landed on Union Desks detailing their brutal Modus Operandi and murky dealings, yet many remain buried among other reports that came in from Ludra’s World (now Free Sanjak).
  Buona Sera is outfitted with some of the newest and most experimental tech offered by the manufacturer, going so far that certain operatives are equipped with prototypes to be used in field testing. The reasons as to why SSC is operating within the Pillars is unknown, only speculations can be made, but most likely it is profit and concerns about new and emerging technologies found within Lanika Corp.</p>

description: <p>As the collective is vast, there was no question that they would appear in the Pillars, the real question was when. The truth is, they always had small cells embedded within a larger criminal structure within the Pillars.
  Part of a secretive division within said organization, operatives observed and waited for the right moment to strike. During this time, they exhibited no major abnormalities, contenting with simple lines of conventional code and physical force in order to achieve their goal. Fielding older, standardized forms of frames, they melded into the shadow of their larger and louder host, Lanika.
  When the latter gave up on staying within the shadows and went public with less shady dealings, the sleeper cells activated and let loose a combination of Electronic and Memetic warheads. They let loose an unknowing amalgam of paracausal code and NHP driven Black ICE, wiping any opposition from the Net. What followed was a brutal take-over of the capital city of Serador on planet XXX in a bloody urban war.
  What remained in the aftermath is an independent city-state under the control of HORUS ONRYŌ. Both on the Omni-net and offline, ONRYŌ monitors and secures, utilizing terror tactics and minimal presence to keep enemies at bay. Now the city of New Serador is a haven for all illegal activity outlawed in Union Space, all under the invisible eye of ONRYŌ.
  Frames produced by HORUS ONRYŌ serve to inspire fear in their enemies and are adapted to the tight space of Urban Warfare. To that end they field an array of domineering, terrifying weapons and systems which break their enemies bodies and minds alike.</p>

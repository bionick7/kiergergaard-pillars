description: <p>By siphoning just enough information out of a Lock-On to not deplete it, this powerful computational Unit first utilizes it in optimizing targeting vectors and feeding back any new information gathered by the attack, leaving a information deficit of less than 0,001 %. </p>
effect: When attacking an enemy which is Locked On with the equipped weapon, you gain +1 to the Attack Roll.

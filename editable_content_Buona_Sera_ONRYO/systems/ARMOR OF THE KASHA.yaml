  detail: <p> You consume a destroyed frame (allied and enemy), removing it from the field, and you gain +1 Armor per frame thus consumed until the end of this scene. These stack and are added unto any pre-existing Armor. </p>
  name: Stack the Dead
description: <p>By copying the original Necro-code and releasing certain parts in controlled bursts, post-natal modifications can be made to the frame. From modifying weapons to repairing the skeletal structure, the most widespread and simple application is the on-the go reinforcement of armor. To onlookers the frame appears to shortly be wreathed in flame, as the molten slag pours over the Hull, however the process utilizes no discernible source of heat.</p>

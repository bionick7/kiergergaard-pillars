effect: <p>You may, as a free Action, instantly scale any wall, obstacle or terrain feature. This does not cost movement and may be up or down. Any adjacent Allied character may use a reaction to also utilize this effect. You expend 1 charge for each character (you included).<p>
description: <p>A combination of chest-mounted grapple systems, the predecessor to the dangerous Harken-Type Cabled Dagger, is able to easily allow  vertical mobility in theaters where this is needed. Firing tungsten-core anchors, the frame is then quickly pulled upwards via high-powered winches and secondary, single-charge thrusters. The force produced is enough to bring along any necessary fire support.<p>

effect: Your Mech Gains the AI property and Edict of Hate
actions:
- activation: Quick Tech
  detail: <p>You overcharge your Frame with malicious code spawned from the hatred of the NHP. Nominate an Enemy within sensors. You alway know their location and whether the amount of Hit Points they have remaining. You ignore the effects of Invisible and Intangible when targeting that enemy and deal an additional +1d6 Bonus damage against them. Furthermore, you gain 1 Accuracy against Saves inflicted from Mechs that are not your target. Your target also ignores Invisible and Intangible when attacking you. </br> However, anytime you end your turn and the enemy is still alive, you take 1d6+X AP Energy damage, where X is the number of rounds this system has been active for (the initial activation round is counted), but you take Half Damage if you damaged your target this Round.Additionally, should someone else destroy your target, your Frame immediately takes 1 Structure and 1 Stress, but does not make a Structure or Stress check. If this is enough to trigger a meltdown, you explode immediately.</p>

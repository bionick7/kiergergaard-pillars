description: <p>Borrowing the technology found within missiles of the BELLA CIAO line, it was fitted into the hilt of a simple double-edged Terashima knife. However, the prototype was too rigid. Feedback and tandem work with the Enclaves produced a flexible hilt hiding small jets, which allowed a singular precise, mid-air propulsion towards another target.<p>

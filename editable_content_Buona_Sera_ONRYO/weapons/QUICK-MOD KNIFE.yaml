description: <p>Small and elegant, these needle-thin knives are made of the same molecular wire used in other SSC products. Here however this has been done to reduce the weight of the blade and handle drastically, allowing a large number of mods to be installed at once. The Comp/Com unit housed in the carrying scabbard is tasked with overseeing the activation codes for various modifications that can be made, taking on any computing or manual activation as needed.<p>
